Come crawling faster (faster)
Obey your master (master)
Your life burns faster (faster)
Obey your master, master

Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
